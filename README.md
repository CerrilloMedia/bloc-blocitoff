__a To-Do List web-app with self-destructing items.__

The primary purpose of this assignment was to create a single-level to-do list application utilizing Devise to generate and maintain user access, Rails for the main framework and Javascript to update the view. Users were then given the opportunity to create, edit, update & delete (CRUD) individual items. Utilizing JavaScript allowed for real-time view updates as items and lists were marked as complete or deleted altogether keeping the user on the current page at all times. I was also tasked at creating a RAKE task to automatically delete to-do items older than 7 days.

#### bonus:
Not required but I decided to incorporate an extra level to this project by adding User Lists which then contained User Items within each list to organize the items a bit better. It was a challenge to say the least when it came down to providing Rails a way to display nested form-errors but the project is one I continue using to this day.
